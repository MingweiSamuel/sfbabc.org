</div>

Each bench has two leg frames at each end of the bench (and possibly more in the middle) to support the seat and backrest slats.
Each _leg frame_ has two legs: a long forwards leg (`L`), and a short backwards leg (`S`),
as well as a seat rest (`A`), a backrest (`B`), and a center spacer (`C`) positioned between `L` and `S`.

The leg template is also used to position screw pilot holes on the slats (the long planks spanning the length of the bench).

## Rests Template

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={templateRests.src}><Image src={templateRests} alt="A diagram of a template containing various shapes, angles, and holes." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The rests template. |
</div>

### Pieces

<div class="caption full no-highlight">
| <a href={templateA.src}><Image src={templateA} alt="Template with `A` piece traced." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The `A` _seat rest_ piece. Mark two holes: one at the back (angled side), and one in the middle. |
</div>
---
<div class="caption full no-highlight">
| <a href={templateB.src}><Image src={templateB} alt="Template with `B` piece traced." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The `B` _backrest_ piece. Mark the two holes closest to the ends. |
</div>
---
<div class="caption full no-highlight">
| <a href={templateC.src}><Image src={templateC} alt="Template with `C` piece traced." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The `C` _center spacer_ piece. Exact hole position is not critical. |
</div>

### Positioning

Trace two `A` seat rests, two `B` backrests, and two `C` center spacers from the template onto your other 2x4x8.
The angled back sides of the `A` pieces should touch, as shown, to ensure all pieces fit.
On the template, the `A` pieces use the two innermost holes, while the `B` pieces use the two outermost holes.

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={cadCutsRests.src}><Image src={cadCutsRests} alt="A wide image of how to cut the rests and spacers from a single 2x4x8." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| Seat rests, backrests, and spacers cut from a single 2x4x8. |
</div>

The two `A` pieces must have their angled back sides touching.
The other pieces can be traced in any order.

## Legs Template

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={templateLegs.src}><Image src={templateLegs} alt="A diagram of a template with angled edges and various holes." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The legs template. |
</div>

### Pieces

Each pieces has three (of the four) holes marked.

<div class="caption full no-highlight">
| <a href={templateL.src}><Image src={templateL} alt="Template with `L` piece traced." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The `L` _long leg_ piece. Uses the full template. Mark the **top** three holes (furthest from the angled foot). |
</div>
---
<div class="caption full no-highlight">
| <a href={templateS.src}><Image src={templateS} alt="Template with `S` piece traced." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| The `S` _short leg_ piece. Mark the **bottom** three holes (closest to the angled foot). |
</div>

If you plan to [anchor your bench to the ground](/guides/install), also mark the two slits near the foot for aligning the mounting brackets.

### Positioning

Trace two short `S` legs and two long `L` legs from the template onto your pressure-treated 2x4x8.
The angled foot cut of adjacent legs should touch, as shown, to ensure all pieces fit.

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={cadCutsLegs.src}><Image src={cadCutsLegs} alt="A wide image of how to cut four leg pieces from a single 2x4x8." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| Four legs cut from a single 2x4x8. |
</div>

The legs can be traced in any order, as long as the angled feet touch.

### Slat Pilot Holes

<div class="caption right">
| <a href={slatHoles.src}><Image src={slatHoles} alt='Leg template piece with pairs of small screw holes marked at 6", 12", and 18".' width={320} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} class="dark-invert" /></a> |
| --- |
| Hole positions on the template. |
</div>

<div class="caption right">
| Bench<br/>length | Hole dist<br/>(2 legs) | Hole dist<br/>(3 legs) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4-5 ft. | 6 in.   | x       |
| 6 ft.   | 12 in.  | x       |
| 7 ft.   | 12 in.* | 6 in.   |
| 8 ft.   | 18 in.* | 12 in.  |
| 10 ft.  | x       | 12 in.  |
| 12 ft.  | x       | 12 in.* |
</div>

We will need to drill pilot holes for the screws that will hold the slats to the leg frames.
The leg frames need to be properly spaced to support the entire length of the bench;
we should avoid any spans between slats greater than 5 ft. to prevent sagging.

The template has small pairs of holes which are 6, 12, and 18 in. from the end.
The table to the right shows the recommended distance for each bench length.
"Hole dist" is the distance from the end of the slat to the outer pilot holes.
Options marked with an asterisk (*) require [brace pieces](#brace-pieces) in the middle of each span to prevent sagging.
Brace pieces and third leg frames should be spaced evenly between the two outer frames.

Align the square end of the template with the end of the slat and find the correct pair of holes.
Keep the drill vertical and use the small (3/32 to 1/8 in.) bit to drill each pilot hole.
Each slat needs a pair of holes for each leg frame and brace piece,
so for example 4-6 ft. benches need four holes, while 7-8 ft. benches need six holes.
