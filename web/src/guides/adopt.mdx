We send our benches out into the world to be loved by all.
But love can leave a mark, such as damage from frequent use, absentminded gifts of litter, or the autographs of graffiti writers.
We need your help to keep our benches clean and safe.

Adopting a bench consists of visiting it for upkeep regularly, ideally at least **once a week**, to ensure it is safe, to buff any tags, and to pick up trash.
To adopt a bench, reach out to <Link href="mailto:contact@sfbabc.org">contact@sfbabc.org</Link> and let us know which bench(es) you would like to adopt.
Busy benches may have multiple adopters to ensure they stay in good condition.
Thank you!

## Bench Upkeep Checklist

At the bottom of each bench page is a form link "Submit Upkeep (Adopters Only)". Only adopters can access this form.
During each visit, the form checklist should be completed and submitted, as described below.
This lets us make sure that every bench is checked on regularly.

### Safety

Ensure the bench is safe by looking for any splitting wood, loose leg anchors, or bending seat slats.
Give the bench a good shake, and sit on it to see if it is stable.
Record any issues.

### Buffing Graffiti

Use spray paint to buff over any tags.
Spray paint is easy to apply and dries quickly, within minutes.
Wait to ensure the paint is dry before anyone sits on it, or leave a note warning of wet paint.

#### Which paint? $HIDE$

Spray paint can be found at hardware stores (Home Depot, Lowes, Ace/Cole Hardware) and art stores (Blick).
Ideally pick a color that matches the existing color of the bench.
Most of our light brown benches match closely with Rust-Oleum's "Warm Caramel", Montana Gold's "Brown Light" or "Nougat", and others.
But ultimately any color buff will discourage further tagging.

Bucket paint can also be used, but it takes much longer to dry, requiring you to add "wet paint" signage.

### Picking Up Trash

Use gloves to pick up any trash around your bench to prevent it from accumulating.

(Unless you have proper protective gear, do not touch any hazardous waste such as needles, broken glass, biohazard materials, etc.)

### Reporting Issues

After completing the upkeep checklist, make sure to report any remaining problems in the final section of the form.
